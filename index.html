            Patricia here is worried about the exams that she has to study for, but also wants to take a break by 
            partaking in her favorite activity which is shopping. To save on time, she is using the extension made
            by our group.

            These sketches are different concepts that our team is deciding between for the paper prototype. Each sketch is 
            unique in the way that our team sees the potential final product for this extension. Each of the sketches tries
            to implement different aspects that our team wants to be included in the final product.
